Myself Makarand Deshpande.
I am a master degree holder in Computer Science with final year project on real time analysis of big data. I did it 4 yrs back and that there were tech limitations and lambda architecture was most sutiable per tech.
Today now with Kafka streaming and SPark Streaming it has become possible ot achieve use cases.
Spark SQL DataFrame have made more standrd now to code and visualize the application on exactly what has been happeningi inside. Plugged with Kafka and Python libraries such has seaborn and matplotlib visualization has become pretty easy.
I am still a learner and would continue to explore Spark.
This repo has all spark code written by me to usecases presented in the trainings on Udemy.
